# Why the PR Intent Checker Action Cannot Directly Call Local MCP Servers

A question might arise: why doesn't the Python code within the `pr-intent-checker` GitHub Action directly call a locally running GitHub MCP (Model Context Protocol) server to use its tools (like `get_pull_request_comments`, `get_issue`, etc.) instead of using standard GitHub API libraries (`requests`, `PyGithub`)?

The answer lies in the fundamental architecture and isolation of GitHub Actions and the intended design of MCP servers:

1.  **Network Isolation:**
    *   **GitHub Actions Runners:** These execute in temporary, isolated virtual environments hosted within GitHub's cloud infrastructure. They have access to the public internet but are separated from your private local network.
    *   **Local MCP Servers:** MCP servers (like the GitHub MCP server) are typically run on your local development machine, within your private network.
    *   **The Boundary:** There is a significant network boundary (firewalls, private vs. public IP addressing, NAT) between the GitHub Action runner in the cloud and the MCP server on your local machine. The runner cannot initiate a direct network connection to your local server.

2.  **MCP Server Accessibility:**
    *   For the Action runner to connect, the MCP server would need to be exposed publicly (requiring complex setup and security risks) or packaged within the action itself (increasing complexity) or run on a self-hosted runner alongside the action (requiring infrastructure management). These approaches negate the simplicity benefits.

3.  **MCP Communication Protocol:**
    *   MCP servers communicate via standard input/output using a specific JSON-RPC protocol.
    *   The Action's Python code would need to be rewritten to act as an MCP *client*, managing the server process lifecycle (if packaged) and handling the low-level stdin/stdout communication, which is far more complex than using a high-level API library.

4.  **Intended Design:**
    *   **MCP Servers:** Designed primarily to enhance *local* development tools (IDEs, chat agents) by providing a standard interface to local resources or external APIs from the context of the local development environment.
    *   **GitHub Actions:** Designed to run automated workflows (CI/CD, checks) within the GitHub platform's isolated environment, typically interacting with external services via standard web APIs (like the GitHub REST or GraphQL API).

**Conclusion:**

Directly calling a local MCP server from within a standard GitHub-hosted Action runner is impractical due to network isolation and architectural design. The recommended approach is:

*   The **GitHub Action** uses standard libraries (`requests`, `PyGithub`, etc.) to interact directly with the official GitHub API.
*   The **MCP Server** is used locally by developers (or tools like chat agents) to assist with tasks like fetching information or fixing code, leveraging its tools which often wrap the same GitHub APIs but provide a different interface suitable for local tooling.

This separation respects the environments and leverages the strengths of each component appropriately.
